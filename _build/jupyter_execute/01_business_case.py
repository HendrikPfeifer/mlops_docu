# # Business Case
# 
# ### Here you can find the business case for the "Used car prices".
# 
# 
# The goal is to use the "used car prices"-dataset to create models that can predict the price of a used car using random variables. The whole tool should then be deployed in a web-app to be used for example by a used car dealer and their customers.
